	      'Created frontend and persistent storage schema for Duct, a secrets and microservice configuration tool, using MongoDB, React, Express, and Node.',
        'Implemented GraphQL for Duct. This will later be very important, as Duct is designed to be used alongside AppDirect\'s existing infrastructure tools, meaning it will be processing huge amounts of information. Due to Duct\'s very interwoven/coupled data, this will make data fetching far easier and efficient.',
        'Implemented Chatops server for platform tools, as well as integrations for 3 of these tools. This eliminates the need for admin UI dashboards, allowing platform admins to receive, review, and solve support tickets via Slack. This is extremely helpful, as the context switching forced by the support tickets heavily impacts productivity. In fact, a 4th of the platform team is always boggled down as "support week engineer" to solely handle these support tickets.'
